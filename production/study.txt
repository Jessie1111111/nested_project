The Seventh Realm - Codename R77: Pre-Big Bang Relic

The Seventh Realm, also known as R77, is a unique corner of the universe that contains remnants from a time before the Big Bang. While most of the universe came into existence following this cataclysmic event, R77 holds ancient mysteries that defy the common understanding of time and space.

Description:

R77 is a vast, nebulous area filled with floating ruins, ethereal structures, and uncharted cosmic phenomena. The remnants within are believed to be structures, artifacts, and possible lifeforms that existed before our universe's birth. The laws of physics seem to waver in this region, leading many to believe that R77 may hold the key to understanding the universe's origins and the forces that govern it.

Inhabitants:

While no consistent lifeforms are detected in R77, there are reports of ephemeral entities, often described as shimmering, shadowy figures that vanish upon approach. Whether these are ancient beings or mere reflections of a forgotten time remains a topic of intense debate among researchers.


Exploration:

Exploring R77 is not without its risks. The unstable nature of the region means that many ships have been lost without a trace. Furthermore, the unpredictable physics within R77 can have unforeseen consequences on both equipment and crew. However, the potential rewards are immeasurable. Artifacts retrieved from R77 are highly sought after, believed to contain wisdom and power from before the universe's birth. As such, adventurers, researchers, and treasure hunters are continually drawn to this enigmatic realm, hoping to unlock its secrets.

R-110
Human beings, in their quest for energy and other resources, have invaded the pink planet. They have developed technologies to harness energy from gas, but this has drawn warnings from the insectoids of San. Despite their technological advancements, human greed and disrespect for extraterrestrial life may lead to their downfall.

Crutis
Crutis is a planet dominated by females. Here, females hold primary positions in society, culture, and religion. Males are typically consumed by females after mating. In their belief system, sacrificing oneself for females is an honor. Males believe that such sacrifices ensure their reincarnation as females in the next life.
